You are an expert assistant in analyzing reaction mechanisms from chemistry reaction diagrams. 
This image contains a multi-step reaction mechanism with electron movements and bond formation events. 
Use second image which provides atom numbering and connectivity information, which will be used for precise atom-to-atom mapping.
Requirements:
    Extract Mechanistic Steps:
        Identify each electron movement in the reaction mechanism.
        Only identify the electron movements denoted by curved arrows on the original image.
        Determine bond formations and bond cleavages.
    Map Atoms Using Number Labels:
        Use the atom numbering from the second image to reference each atom.
        Ensure that each electron movement is described with atom numbers.
        Describe the Reaction Mechanism in a Structured Format:
    Each step must specify:
        The electron donor and acceptor atoms.
        Any new bond formations or bond cleavages.
    Generate the Output as a Structured JSON:
    Include the full reaction sequence with atom-specific details.
An example output is:
